Mol\-Sim is a simulation program for molecular dynamics. It offers implementations for several different methods for force calculation, input and output.

The current build simulates the collision of two bodies using the Lennard-\/\-Jones-\/\-Potential. The result is saved in a V\-T\-K-\/file, which can be visualized using Para\-View.
